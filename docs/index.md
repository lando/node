# Node

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Beyond running web applications, it is also commonly used for frontend tooling.

You can easily add it to your Lando app by adding an entry to the [services](https://docs.lando.dev/services/lando-3.html) top-level config in your [Landofile](https://docs.lando.dev/landofile/).

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: node:16
    command: npm start
```

## Patch versions

::: warning Not officially supported!
While we allow users to specify patch versions for this service, they are not *officially* supported, so if you use one, YMMV.
:::

To use a patch version, you can do something as shown below:

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: node:16.13.1
```

But make sure you use one of the available [patch tags](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/tags) for the underlying image we are using.
